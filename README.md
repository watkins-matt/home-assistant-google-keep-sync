# Google Keep Sync for Home Assistant

[![Tests](https://github.com/watkins-matt/home-assistant-google-keep-sync/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/watkins-matt/home-assistant-google-keep-sync/actions/workflows/test.yml)

Google Keep Sync is an unofficial custom integration for Home Assistant that allows users to synchronize their Google Keep lists with Home Assistant. This project is in no way affiliated with, created, or endorsed by Google.

## Why?

There are existing Home Assistant integrations for Google Keep, why create a new one? Basically, I tried all of them and none of them quite worked the way I wanted them to.

## Features

Bidirectional synchronization of lists between Google Keep and Home Assistant. You select the lists
you wish to sync, and they are created as todo
entities in your Home Assistant instance.

## Requirements

As a result of the fact that we are using the new todo entities that were introduced in Home Assistant 2023.11, you must be running that version or later.

## Installation

Google Keep Sync can be installed either manually or via HACS, although using
HACS is strongly recommended.

### Installation via HACS
    
1. **Add Integration via HACS**:

    If you already have HACS installed, you can simply click this button:

    [![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=watkins-matt&repository=home-assistant-google-keep-sync&category=integration)
    - Click `Download`.
    - Restart Home Assistant.

    Alternatively, you can follow these instructions to add it via HACS:

    1. **Add Custom Repository**:
        - Open HACS in Home Assistant.
        - Go to `Integrations`.
        - Click on the `...` in the top right corner and select `Custom repositories`.
        - Add the URL `https://github.com/watkins-matt/home-assistant-google-keep-sync`
        - Set the category to `Integration` and click `Add`.

    1. **Install the Integration**:
        - Search for `Google Keep Sync` in the HACS Integrations.
        - Click `Download`.
        - Restart Home Assistant.

1. **Configure Integration**:
    - Go to `Settings` -> `Devices & Services`.
    - Click `Add Integration`.
    - Search for and select `Google Keep Sync`.
    - Enter your Google account username.
    - Generate and use an **App Password** for your Google account (see <https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords>).
    - Follow the prompts to select the Google Keep lists you want to synchronize with Home Assistant.

### Manual Installation

1. **Copy Integration Files**: Download the `google_keep_sync` folder and place it into the `custom_components` directory of your Home Assistant installation. If `custom_components` doesn't exist, create it in the same directory as your `configuration.yaml`.

2. **Restart Home Assistant**: Restart your Home Assistant to load the new integration.

3. **Configuration**:
    - Go to `Settings` -> `Devices & Services`.
    - Click `Add Integration`.
    - Search for and select `Google Keep Sync`.
    - Enter your Google account username.
    - Generate and use an **App Password** for your Google account (see <https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords>).
    - Follow the prompts to select the Google Keep lists you want to synchronize with Home Assistant.

## Usage

After setup, your selected Google Keep lists will be available in Home Assistant. You can view and interact with these lists, and any changes you make in Home Assistant will be instantly synced to Google Keep.

## Services

As a result of the fact that we are working directly with native todo entities, you can
use the built-in services to add, remove and update items from your synchronized lists.

### Available Services

- `todo.add_item`
- `todo.remove_item`
- `todo.update_item`

## Limitations

- **Polling Interval**: While changes made in Home Assistant are instantly reflected in Google Keep, changes made in Google Keep are not instantly reflected in Home Assistant. The integration polls Google Keep for updates every 15 minutes. Therefore, any changes made directly in Google Keep will be visible in Home Assistant after the next polling interval.

- **Authentication**: Use of an app password is strongly recommended, as there is no way for accounts with 2-Factor-Authentication to be connected otherwise. This will also allow you to easily revoke access to the integration without affecting your Google account and requiring you to change your password.

## Security

As an additional security precaution, you can sign up for a new Google account to use exclusively with this integration. Afterward, on your primary account, add this new Google account as a collaborator on any lists you wish to synchronize.

Then provide the credentials for this new account (preferably still using an app password) to the integration. This will allow the integration limited access your Google Keep lists without having access to your entire primary Google account.

## Troubleshooting

Encountering issues? Here are some common problems and their potential solutions:

### Invalid Authentication Errors

If you're experiencing `Invalid authentication` errors, it could be due to incompatible versions of certain underlying libraries used by the integration, such as OpenSSL. To resolve this, consider using a manually-retrieved token for authentication instead of a password.

#### Generating a Token

Note that this method is provided as a temporary workaround, and may not work depending on your environment.

To generate a token:

1. Download scripts/fetch_token.py and scripts/requirements.txt to your computer which has Python installed.

2. Install the requirements from the `requirements.txt` file. This ensures that all necessary dependencies are installed in your Python environment.

    ```bash
    pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the `fetch_token.py` script located in the `scripts` directory of the integration. This script will guide you through the process of generating a token.

    ```bash
    python scripts/fetch_token.py
    ```

4. Once generated, use this token in the integration's configuration process by entering it into the token field (leave the password field blank).

### Sync Delays

- Remember that changes made in Google Keep might not immediately reflect in Home Assistant due to the polling interval of the integration, which is set to every 15 minutes.

### Connection Issues

- If you're unable to connect, check your network settings and ensure your Home Assistant instance can access the internet.

### Integration Does Not Appear in Home Assistant

- After installing via HACS or manually, ensure you have restarted Home Assistant.
- Check the `custom_components` directory to verify that the `google_keep_sync` folder is present and correctly named.

### Lists Not Syncing

- Ensure the lists you want to sync are selected during the integration setup.
- Verify that the Google account used has access to the desired Google Keep lists.

This is an unofficial integration and is not created, endorsed, or supported by Google.
